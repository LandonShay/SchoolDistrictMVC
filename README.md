# SchoolDistrictMVC

>This application is a simulation of a database owned by a school district. It allows one to view all of a school district's schools, teachers, students, and classes.
>It also has several other features, such as assigning students to classes, viewing what classes a student is enrolled in, and more. It also features a custom interface
>that is aestetically pleasing and easy to use. For the sake of convenience, I chose not to implement authorization levels, since being simple to use was a goal of mine.
>s
>I have also seeded in a number of schools, teachers, classes, and students so that the application can be easily tested. While the teachers and school have already 
>been assigned to the classes, you must assign the students to them yourself. 

## To Run the application, do the following:
1. Clone Repo 
2. Ensure all packages are installed upon cloning
3. Run `update-database` in the Package Manager Console.
4. It is now ready to run.
